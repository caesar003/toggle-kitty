# toggle-kitty

**toggle-kitty** is a lightweight script that lets you toggle the visibility of the Kitty terminal emulator, making it behave like a dropdown terminal (similar to Tilda or Yakuake).

This script checks if the Kitty terminal is running, then either minimizes or activates its window depending on the current state, providing easy access to your terminal with a single command.

## Features

-   Quickly show or hide the Kitty terminal.
-   Mimics dropdown terminal behavior without requiring additional software.

## Important Note

Currently, **toggle-kitty** does not function as intended under the Wayland display server due to `xdotool`'s limited compatibility with Wayland. To use this script smoothly, log in using an **X11 session** instead of Wayland.

## Requirements

-   **xdotool**: Ensure `xdotool` is installed, as itâ€™s used to detect and manage window states.

    Install `xdotool` with:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y xdotool
    ```

## Installation

You can install **toggle-kitty** in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toggle-kitty.git
    cd toggle-kitty
    ```

2. Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

### Option 2: Download the .deb Package

Alternatively, you can download the `.deb` package from the [releases page](https://github.com/caesar003/toggle-kitty/releases).

After downloading, install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install ./toggle-kitty.deb
```

## Usage

Simply run the command:

```bash
toggle-kitty
```

### Behavior

-   **If Kitty is running and active**: The script will minimize the Kitty window.
-   **If Kitty is running but inactive**: The script will bring the Kitty window to the foreground.

This allows quick toggling of the Kitty terminal without needing to navigate manually.

## Example

Run the script as shown below to toggle the Kitty terminal:

```bash
toggle-kitty
```

## Troubleshooting

-   **Kitty Not Found**: Ensure Kitty is running and installed on your system.
-   **xdotool Command Not Found**: Verify that `xdotool` is installed.
-   **Not Working in Wayland**: Due to Wayland limitations, log in using an X11 session to use `toggle-kitty` smoothly.
